Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm in the style of merge sort. The basic idea is to find a “pivot” item in the array to compare all other items against, then shift items such that all of the items before the pivot are less than the pivot value and all the items after the pivot are greater than the pivot value. After that, recursively perform the same operation on the items before and after the pivot.

Bubble sort is the most basic way to sort a collection, and the most slowlest. It works by sequentially going through your array and comparing two values at a time, swapping them if necessary. It then repeats the process until no swaps are required.
